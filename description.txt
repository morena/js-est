Build a JavaScript application that;
- Validates the input fields against the following rules;
	- the text input must only contain alpha, numeric, or whitespace characters
	- the checkbox must be checked
	- one radio button is checked
	- an option other than 'please select' is chosen from the drop-down
- When the form is valid make an AJAX request for /data/test.json
- On success of the request build the new set of panels out of the data and append them to the results section
- On failure of the request display an error message

The application must be written in such a way so that any generic functionality is re-usable.

The application can make use of any third-party libraries deemed necessary.
